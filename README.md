# laliga_football_prediction
The following repository contains several notebooks about football result prediction and deeper analysis. The starting point dataset was downloaded from kaggle. link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ricardomoya/football-matches-of-spanish-league

This repository contains a project paper which explains the goals, process and results of the project. Several notebooks have been used in this project. 
Each notebook contains different information and analysis:
-EDA_laliga_dataset: Exploratory data analysis from the dataset and some initial graphics. 

-laliga_dataset_optimization: Feature Engineering, rows removal and some features selection. Lots of features are created from the basic inital dataset

-modeling_notebook: Contains encoding, normalizing, metric selection and the training of the models process. It also contains model testing. 

-streak_analysis: Model analysis with different type of football team streaks. It also has some graphics.

-rf_test_analysis: It contains the error analysis of 'season','round' and teams. It also includes the draws~accuracy study.

The paper _football_result_prediction_paper.pdf_ may be a great guide for the code.
